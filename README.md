# TMDB Box Office Prediction

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the box office revenue of movies using data from The Movie Database (TMDB). By analyzing various features such as budget, genres, release date, and cast, the model attempts to predict the total revenue generated by each movie. This project was completed during an internship at Infosys, guided by mentor **S Muni Kiran**.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TMDB-Box-Office-Prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TMDB-Box-Office-Prediction

3. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the TMDB data:
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   
2. Training the Model: To train the model, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   
3. Predicting: Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input new_movie_data.csv

4. Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using test data:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
